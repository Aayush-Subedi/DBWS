Implemented here is the website using php and some javascript. The website includes a maintanance
page that allows the user to insert into the database all the different kinds of data.
If there exists a foreign key, there should be a find [entity] button that allows the 
user to find a suitable foreign key donor from available keys.

The website can be found hosted at http://clabsql.clamv.jacobs-university.de/~mhaile/index.html
