The map is Implemented in pages/map.php. There is a map link in the footer of the 
site that can be used to go to the map page. The api used is ipinfo which can be
quite inaccurate compared to other services but that was the service recommended for 
this assignment. The user's ip is also shown in the location.

**If you have an adblocker the map won't work and an alert will be shown if that 
reminds you turn of your adblocker
