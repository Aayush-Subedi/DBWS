There are a total of 5 autocomplete fields. One is the search bar found on the header which searches for 
items. Once the user starts typing, all items starting with the series of letters the user enters will show up.
If the user presses enter without completing writing, all items that match what has been written will be shown in new page.

The second autocomplete field is found in Queries/Item. This one works the same as the above and will present items
that start with what the user has typed. The database username and password have to be entered for it to work.

The third one is found in Queries/Rental history. When the user starts typing the first name of a user, all matching
first names will show up. 

The fourth one is found in Queries/Item by rating. Works the same way as above and searches for items.

The last one is in Queries/Items offered by renter. This one searches for renters depending on what the user writes.


Database username is group17
password is IINsT1
